initially react js was written in high level js and vrowser understand low level js thats why webhack and 
babble tools used to convert high level react js into low level js undrerstood by browser.

in package.json file react-scripts file help to not deal with babble and web-hack

react-script-start start the app and open it on localhost server 3000

in src folder our application lives

in public folder files that convert our react js to old js resides

react-script-build put our src react file into public folder.
